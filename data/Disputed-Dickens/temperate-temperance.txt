TEMPERATE TEMPERANCE. 

We want to know, and we always have wanted 
to know, why the English workman is to be pa- 
tronised ? Why are his dwelling-place, his house- 
keeping arrangements, the organisation of his 
cellar, and his larder nay, the occupation of his 
leisure hours even why are all these things re- 
garded as the business of everybody except him- 
self ? Why is his beer to be a question agitating 
the minds of society, more than our sherry ? Why 
is his visit to the gallery of the theatre, a more 
suspicious proceeding than our visit to the 
stalls ? Why is his perusal of his penny news- 
paper so aggravating to the philanthropical 
world, that it longs to snatch it out of his hand 
and substitute a number of the Band of Hope 
Review ? 

It is not the endeavour really and honestly to 
improve the condition of the lower classes which 
we would discourage, but the way in which that 
endeavour is made. Heaven knows, the work- 
ing classes, and especially the lowest working 
classes, want a helping hand sorely enough. No 
one who is at all familiar with a poor neighbour- 
hood can doubt that. But you must help them 
judiciously. You must look at things with their 
eyes, a little ; you must not always expect them 
to see with your eyes. The weak point in almost 
every attempt which has beenmaae to deal with 
the lower classes is invariably the same too 
much is expected of them. You ask them to do, 
simply the most difficult thing in the world you 
ask them to change their habits. Your standard 
is too high. The transition from the White- 
chapel cellar to the comfortable rooms in the 
model-house, is too violent; the habits which 
the. cellar involved would have to be abandoned ; 
a great effort would have to be made ; and to 
abandon habits and make great efforts is hard 
work even for clever, good, and educated people. 

The position of the lowest poor in London 
and elsewhere, is so terrible, they are so un- 
manageable, so deprived of 'energy through vice 
and low living and bad lodging, and so little 
ready to second any efforts that are made for 
their benefit, that those who have dealings with 
them are continually tempted to abandon their 
philanthropic endeavours as desperate, and to 
turn their attention towards another class : 
those, namely, who are one degree higher in the 
social scale, and one degree less hopeless. 



It is proposed just now, as everybody knows, 
to establish, in different poor neighbourhoods, 
certain great dining-halls and kitchens for the 
use of poor people, on the plan of those esta- 
blishments which have been highly successful in 
Glasgow and Manchester. The plan is a good 
one, and we wish it every success on certain 
conditions. The poor man who attends one of 
these eating-houses must be treated as the rich 
man is treated who goes to a tavern. The thing 
must not be made a favour of. The custom of 
the diner-out is to be solicited as a thing on 
which the prosperity of the establishment de- 
pends. The officials, cooks, and all persons who 
are paid to be the servants of the man who dines, 
are to behave respectfully to him, as hired ser- 
vants should; he is not to be patronised, or 
ordered about, or read to, or made speeches at, 
or in any respect used less respectfully than he 
would be in a beef and pudding shop, or other 
house of entertainment. Above all, he is to be 
jolly, he is to enjoy himself, he is to have his 
beer to drink; while, if he show any sign of 
being drunk or disorderly, he is to be turned 
out, just as I should be ejected from a club, or 
turned out of the Wellington or the Albion 
Tavern this very day, if I got drunk there. 

There must be none of that Sunday-school 
mawkishness, which too much pervades our 
dealings with the lower classes ; and we must 
get it into our heads which seems harder to 
do than many people would imagine that the 
working man is neither a felon, nor neces- 
sarily a drunkard, nor a very little child. Our 
wholesome plan is to get him to co-operate with 
us. Encourage him to take an interest in the 
success of the undertaking, and, above all things, 
be very sure that it pays, and pays well, so that 
the scheme is worth going into without any 
philanthropic flourishes at all. He is already 
flourished to death, and he hates to be flourished 
to, or flourished about. 

There is a tendency in the officials who are 
engaged in institutions organised for the benefit 
of the poor, to fall into one of two errors ; to be 
rough and brutal, which is the Poor-law Board 
style ; or cheerfully condescending, which is the 
Charitable Committee style. Both these tones 
are offensive to the poor, and well they may be. 
The proper tone is that of the tradesman at 
whose shop the workman deals, who is glad to 
serve him, and who makes a profit out of his 
custom. Who has not been outraged by observ- 
ing that cheerfully patronising mode of dealing 
with poor people which is in vogue at our soup- 
kitchens and other depots of alms ? There is a 
particular manner of looking at the soup through 
a gold double eye-glass, or of tasting it, and 
saying, " Monstrous good monstrous good in- 
deed ; why, I should like to dine off it myself!" 
which is more than flesh and blood can bear. 

We must get rid of all idea of enforcing what 
is miscalled temperance which is in itself any- 
thing but a temperate idea. A man must be 
allowed to have his beer with his dinner, though 
he must not be allowed to make a beast of himself. 
Some account was given not long since, in these 


pages, of a certain, soldiers' institute at Chat- 
ham; it was then urged that by all means 
the soldiers ought to be supplied with beer 
on the premises, in order that the institution 
might compete on fair terms with the public- 
house. It was decided, however, by those in 
authority, or by some of them, that this beer was 
not to be. The consequence is, as was predicted, 
that the undertaking, which had every other 
element of success, is very far from being in a 
flourishing condition. And similarly, this excel- 
lent idea of dining-rooms for the working classes 
will also be in danger of failing, if that important 
ingredient in a poor man's dinner a mug of 
beer is not to be a part of it. 

The cause of temperance is not promoted 
by any intemperate measures. It is intemperate 
conduct to assert that fermented liquors ought 
not to be drunk at all, because, when taken 
in excess, they do harm. Wine, and beer, 
and spirits, have their place in the world. We 
should try to convince the working man that 
he is acting foolishly if he give more importance 
to drink than it ought to have But we have no 
right to inveigh against drink, though we have 
a distinct right to inveigh against drunkenness. 
There is no intrinsic harm in beer ; far from it ; 
and so, by raving against it, we take up a line 
of argument from which we may be beaten 
quite easily by any person who has the simplest 
power of reasoning. The real temperance cause 
is injured by intemperate advocacy ; and an 
argument which we cannot honestly sustain is 
injurious to the cause it is enlisted to support. 
Suppose you forbid the introduction of beer into 
one of these institutions, and you are asked 
your reason for doing so, what is your answer ? 
That you are afraid of drunkenness. There is 
some danger in the introduction of gas into a 
building. You don't, exclude it ; but you place 
it under certain restrictions, and use certain pre- 
cautions to prevent explosions. Why don't you 
do so with beer ? 


A kecent fatal encounter between a French 
nobleman and a luckless Irish gentleman fur- 
nishes a fresh text for showing on what footing 
duelling stands in that country. France has 
always been notorious for such combats ; French 
memoirs overflow with duels; and French novels 
are sprinkled with details of spirited quarrels 
sure to be arranged by this useful machinery. 
Yet, up to a recent date, the Customs of Quar- 
rels, the Rules and Precedents, remained wholly 
undigested. 

The Irish constitutions of Clonmel, explained 
in a previous article,* were before them by 
many decades of years. A French code was at 
last " redacted," and something like order and 
system introduced. The new pandects were 
signed by eleven peers, twenty - five general 
officers, and fifty superior officers. Nearly all the 
maires and prefets gave in their adhesion, and even 



the minister of war, being restrained by a par- 
donable delicacy, and the awkwardness of official 
position, from attaching his signature, took the 
trouble of writing a formal letter, to be pub- 
lished hereafter, signifying his approval of the 
entire arrangements. Many of the regulations 
are transparently borrowed from the Irish con- 
stitution. The important axiom of a blow ad- 
mitting of no verbal apology whatever, and the 
almost casuistical theories as to what consti- 
tutes " the insulted party," are common to 
both. The French code, however, is curious, a3 
illustrating the different shapes of duello which 
it recognises. 

There are three instruments which the code 
of duelling recognises : the small-sword, the 
sabre, and the pistol. In France, the first 
is looked upon as the national and accepted 
shape; the others are more or less barbaric 
and exceptional. Most Frenchmen are fencers, 
and learn that useful science as an accomplish- 
ment. A French father does not, indeed, from 
his dying bed press upon his child the duty of 
being " always ready with the pistol," which 
was the affectionate testamentary farewell of an 
Irish gentleman of some repute in these en- 
counters, but he will take care to leave his son 
well grounded in the management of the rapier. 
Up to a recent period a Frenchman, when chal- 
lenged, invariably selected pistols. 

The constitutions, however, distinctly recog- 
nise the pistol, and the peculiar variations 
which that special shape of wager of battle is 
allowed to take. First, the rude Anglo-Irish 
and semi-barbaric system may be adopted in all 
its rugged simplicity : a measured distance, 
the two combatants facing each other, and a 
signal. So might Rousseau's Indians, out of 
their State of Nature, and furnished by a par- 
donable anachronism with the explosive wea- 
pons of civilisation, decide their quarrel about 
the charms of a squaw. The simplicity was 
hideous. See how it can be refined into an 
elegant and more exciting pastime. First, for a 
duel a volonte, according to the technical name. 
Two lines, distant from thirty-five to forty paces, 
are marked off; within which are drawn two 
other lines, from fifteen to twenty paces apart, 
which is the nearest approach tolerated. Ac- 
cording to the .canon of the duel a volonte, the 
combatants advance cautiously, starting from 
the outside line, and holding their pistols down- 
wards. They can halt when they please, and can 
take aim when they halt, but not fire, which is 
only allowed when the line is reached. Thus, if 
one desires to have the first shot, he may walk 
on quickly till he reach the line, and then fire ; 
but he has the disadvantages of a hasty aim, and 
a long range. The moment he lias fired, he must 
remain steadily in his place, a prey to the most 
uncomfortable feelings, until his adversary shall 
have adjusted his aim, and covered him. On 
this account, in Ireland, there has always been 
a reasonable prejudice in favour of receiving 
the adversary's fire; the apparent risk being 
more than counterbalanced by the enormous 
advantage of a quiet aim, without the disturbing 

 influence of a hostile barrel, which, must 
naturally confuse and agitate. 

The duel a marche interrompue appears at first 
sight to differ little from the one last described ; 
but there are grave and important points of dis- 
tinction. Out of these various shapes of en- 
counter the skilful amateur will find his advan- 
tage according to his experience, and the pecu- 
liar manner he will have acquired during that 
experience. There are the same lines, and the 
same distances marked off. But the parties 
advance in a zig-zag direction halting and ad- 
vancing like Indian skirmishers with power to 
fire the moment either halts. This is the grand 
distinction not one of form, it will be observed, 
but of principle, and much to be recommended 
to novices, who might naturally be agitated by 
their debut. They will thus secure an early 
shot with a freedom from disturbing influences. 
There is, of course, always the drawback of 
having to accept the adversary's fire without sign 
or protest. It should be mentioned, that as 
soon as one has fired, the other is not allowed 
to advance further, but must discharge his pistol 
from the point at which he is standing. 

Next follows the duel au signal, which is an 
approach to the old Hiberno-Britannic fashion, 
and was doubtless meant to conciliate national 
prejudice. The signal was to be given by three 
claps of the hand, with an interval of three 
seconds between each. At the first, the parties 
were to move slowly towards each other ; at the 
second, to level, still walking ; at the third, to 
halt and fire. The French code states that if 
one fires before or after the signal, by so much 
as half a second, he shall be considered a dis- 
honourable man; and if by the disgraceful 
manoeuvre he shall have killed his adversary, he 
shall be looked on as an assassin. To minds 
less nice there would appear but little distinc- 
tion between the cases. But if the adversary 
who has been fired at thus dishonourably have 
been lucky enough to escape, he is allowed a 
terrible retribution to take a slow deliberate 
aim, and a shot a loisir. Where one disgrace- 
fully reserves his fire after the signal, the dis- 
agreeable duty is allotted to the seconds of rush- 
ing in at all risk and peril even in front of the 
weapon, if no other course will answer and dis- 
arming him. 

Then follows the Barriere, which is, strictly 
speaking, a generic term, and applicable to any 
shape of combat where a line of separation be- 
tween the parties is enforced. Sometimes the term 
is applied to an arrangement by which the parties 
are set back to back, and at a given signal must 
march away ten, or any special number of paces, 
then turn round smartly and fire. This is, per- 
haps, the most humane sort of duel, as there are 
many chances that the parties will miss each 
other. Whereas the Englishman who has gra- 
duated on the bogs and moors will have a fatal 
advantage in this flurried style of shooting. 
Allowance, however, should be made for a profit- 
able experience of our neighbours among the 
robins and sparrows a good range of practice 
among those tiny warblers of the grove and 



bushes contributing to steady the eye and hand 
very considerably. 

There is also the duel a marche non inter- 
rompue et a ligne parallele a rather cumber- 
some title for a very simple mode of arrange- 
ment. The inevitable parallel lines are traced 
at about fifteen paces' distance (though it seems 
a little mysterious how those marks can be 
" traced" along the green sward of the Bois de 
Boulogne), and the parties are started from 
points exactly opposite each other. They can 
walk either fast or slow, and can fire when they 
please, but are not allowed to stop or to reserve 
their fire a second after reaching the end of 
the march. This system, however, is not open 
to the objection of being too favourable to the 
person who receives the first fire and reserves 
his own, for he is compelled to be en route 
while taking his aim, and is limited by time and 
the short distance he has to walk. 

Next in the gory annals of French duelling 
comes the fashion of turning the two adversaries 
into a dark room, armed each with a pair of pis- 
tols ; then, that Mexican practice of an encounter 
on horseback, armed with weapons of every kind. 
The first is worthy of gladiatorial days and the 
most savage of the emperors, and there is some- 
thing horrible in the notion of the two caged 
men creeping round by the wall, with finger 
on the trigger, scarcely daring to breathe for 
fear of giving their enemy a hint of their po- 
sition. There was room, too, for all manner 
of artful devices to make the enemy deliver 
his fire first, the light from which would illu- 
minate his figure, and render him a favourable 
object. But these shapes of action the French 
code looks on as exceptional and highly irre- 
gular, refusing to take any notice of them, or 
apply its ordinances to their case. It throws 
out only one contemptuous hint in reference to 
them namely, that all stipulations and arrange- 
ments must be put in writing. 

The terrible duel a, I'outrance, where so 
desperate was the character of the offence it 
was agreed that one of the parties should die on 
the ground, was contrived by loading one pistol 
only. The other was primed merely, and the 
second holding them behind his back, the 
parties chose, by saying " To the right," or, " To 
the left." Then the end of a pocket-handkerchief 
was placed in each of their hands, and the fatal 
signal given. If the holder of the pistol pulled 
the trigger before the signal, he was justly dealt 
with as an assassin, in the case of his having the 
loaded weapon. In case of its proving the 
empty one, the opponent had the privilege of 
putting the muzzle to his head and shooting 
him on the spot. But these extravagances 
outpourings of an indecent and ungentlemanly 
animosity received but little toleration, and the 
genteel code, as was mentioned, takes no cogni- 
sance of its incidents. Of the dramatic ele- 
ments involved in a " situation" of this sort, 
that skilful dramatist, M. Dumas the elder, was 
not slow to avail himself ; he has worked this 
strata up according to true "Saint Martin's- 
gate" traditions, in his melodrama of Pauline. 







The chronicles of the Bois de Boulogne (taking 
that arena in its widest sense as symbolical of 
such battle-grounds all over Trance) show many 
encounters between Frenchmen and foreigners. 
But the Bois de Boulogne has been invaded by the 
beautifiers of the Empire, and its pleasant privacy 
for such meetings disturbed. It used to enjoy the 
distinction of being the traditional locus in quo 
of all tournaments, just as Chalk Farm was the 
ting-place for London, and The Fifteen 
Acres/" be they more or less" as the attorney 
writing his challenge observed with professional 
accuracy for Dublin. 

Going down to Marseilles about the month of 
March, seventeen hundred and sixty-five, we dis- 
cover Lord Kilmaurs,the eldest son of the Scotch 
Earl of Glencarne, sitting in the theatre of that 
wonderful Mediterranean city. He happened to 
be very deaf, and, witli the perversity of those 
afflicted in that way, talked with an earnest 
loudness. A.French officer in the next box, 
with devout attention to the performance, which 
we have not yet reached to, and that intempe- 
rate manner of reproving interruption, in which 
we are yet happily fal* behind them, stood up 
and called out roughly, " Paix ! paix !" This 
admonition was unintelligible to the deaf lord, 
who maintained his conversation at the same 
level of pitch. The injunction was repeated 
several times with the same result. Thereupon 
the polite Frenchman rose, and, stooping over, 
said, with great violence, " Taisez-vous !" To 
him the viscount, at last restored to hearing, 

fave some short answer, and talked a good 
eal louder to show his disregard. It chanced 
then that the officer changed his box, and later 
on the English lord, who was wandering round 
the house, happened to come into this very box, 
of all boxes in the world, and, in utter uncon- 
sciousness, stood at the door, his eyes roaming 
over the features of the officer. The latter, then 
boiling with rage at this apparent determination 
to insult him, started up and flew at the Eng- 
lishman, asking him what he meant by staring at 
him. The other, no doubt bethinking him of the 
well-known proverb, said he had a right to look 
at any one even of royal rank. On which the 
officer flew at him, dragged him down into the 
street, and struck him on the shoulder with his ' 
naked sword. Upon which the deaf lord drew 
his sword gallantly ; but, before he could make 
more than a pass or two, was run through the 
body, the officer's sword coming out at his 
shoulder-blade. Those familiar with this gay and 
Eastern port can fancy that scene in the open 
Place hard by to the Canebiere, with the lighted 
cafes not yet were the days of the gorgeous 
and fantastic Cafe Turc and the coloured 
awnings from the windows fluttering in the air, 
and the great Mediterranean rolling up to the 
shore a few yards away. Shrieks for the watch, 
a crowd, pouring fresh from the parterre, gather- 
ing round, and the Marquis de Pecquigny, at 
the head of his guard, hurrying up to the spot 
where the poor Englishman was lying. He was 
gasping for breath, choking for want of air, while 
the crowd, with the stupidity of all crowds, 



pressed in still closer on him. But the French 
guard made a ring round him, and saved his life 
for once. He was still, however, gasping and 
struggling there, when a surgeon, who had been 
at the play, came up, slit open the collar of his 
shirt, had him lifted up, and some water given to 
him. He was all but dead, and could not speak; 
but, wonderful to relate, in three days was per- 
fectly well. Some little international difficulty 
was apprehended at first, but the English ambas- 
sador at Paris soon set all straight. 

Two years before the great French Revolu- 
tion, a French officer unguardedly delivered 
himself of the aphorism that "the English army 
had more phlegm than spirit" a sentiment 
which really had a substratum of truth, but was 
awkwardly worded. He should have said that 
phlegm was one shape of the spirit of the British 
army. The name of this incautious Frenchman 
was artfully veiled under that of the Chevalier 
la B., and that of the English officer, who 
promptly challenged him, was thinly disguised 
under that of Captain S., of the Eleventh 
Regiment. The offence would appear to have 
been so deadly that the parties were placed at 
the alarmingly short distance of only five paces ! 
Captain S. fired first, and his ball " took place," 
to use the words of the authorised report of the 
transaction, on the chevalier's breast, but, by a 
marvel of good luck, was stopped by a metal 
button. The chevalier, touched by so happy a 
deliverance, magnanimously fires in the air, and 
acknowledges that the English have both spirit 
and phlegm. In illustration of this fortunate 
escape, it may be mentioned that, some forty 
years ago, a person connected with the family 
of the writer of these notes, was riding out 
one morniug in Ireland, accompanied by sym- 
pathising friends, to arrange a little "diffi- 
culty" of the same description. When at the 
gate his eye fell upon a horse-shoe. With ob- 
streperous cries of rejoicing he was called on to 
dismount and pick it up. All felicitated him on 
so lucky an omen. He put it into his pocket, and 
his adversary's ball actually struck it over the 
region of the heart and glanced off at an angle. 

Shortly after the battle of Waterloo, an un- 
lucky pamphlet found its way into Frescati 
the conversation-rooms at the watering-place of 
Bagneres. This pamphlet took pretty much 
the same odd view of the battle of Toulouse as 
M. Thiers has recently done of Waterloo. An 
Englishman chanced to take it up, and wrote on 
the margin that "everything in it was false; 
that Lord Wellington had gained a complete 
victory, and the French army were indebted to 
his generosity for not having been put to the 
sword." A hot young Frenchman of the place, 
named Pinac, at once called out the indiscreet 
Englishman. Everything was done to accom- 
modate matters ; and we are told that even the 
authorities delicately and considerately inter- 
fered, so far as moral suasion might be effectual. 
But all these good offices proved ineffectual, and 
the representatives of the two nations met on the 
ground. Poor Pinac gave one more illustration of 
the insufficiency of this mode of adjusting a quar- 


rel, for at the first fire he received the English- 
man's ball in the stomach, and died shortly 
after.

The season after the first abdication of Na- 
poleon, and more particularly after the battle 
of Waterloo, was, it is well known, very fruit- 
ful in quarrels between French and English 
officers. That pleasant gossip, Captain Gro- 
now, has furnished many incidents illustrative 
of this spirit. It is a fact, that the French 
spent days and nights practising fencing; and 
even resorted to the device of dressing up 
fencing-masters in officers' clothes, and setting 
them to pick quarrels with the English. It 
became impossible for these latter to avoid 
a conflict with men burning with rage and 
mortification, and determined to insult their 
conquerors. At Bordeaux, the Frenchmen used 
to come across the Garonne for the express 
purpose of picking a quarrel; and as the 
challenge usually came from the English, the 
French had the choice of weapons, and inva- 
riably selected their favourite small-sword. 
Strange to say, the result was usually in fa- 
vour of our countrymen, who, being utterly 
belpless at carte, and tierce, and all the nice- 
ties of the exercise, unconsciously reproduced 
the scene in Moliere's Bourgeois, rushed on, 
in defiance of guards and passes, and cut down 
their enemy at once. In vain the Frenchmen 
protested that this was " brutal " and " unchi- 
valrous," that it was a crying outrage against 
" les regies d'escrime." Stalwart Englishmen 
stood by their friend, and, producing loaded 
pistols, threatened to shoot any who attempted 
to interfere. This system gradually produced 
a more wholesome state of feeling. 

One night a party of English and Irish 
officers were at the little Theatre de la Gaite, 
where some French officers tried the usual 
devices to engage them in a quarrel. The 
Frenchmen had their swords, which they drew 
at once, with the alacrity of their country; 
unfortunately, the Anglo-Hibernian party had 
none. They, however, rapidly broke up all the 
chairs and tables' at hand, and converting the 
fragments into useful weapons of offence, shi- 
vered every sword opposed to them, utterly rout- 
ing their opponents. In the delicate situation in 
which the occupying army was placed, there 
was an inclination to make every allowance for 
wounded sensibilities ; but it was found impos- 
sible to brook the offensive behaviour of the na- 
tives, and their studious insults. And the English 
authorities knew the temper of the situation so 
well, that none of the surviving offenders were 
visited with severe punishment. 

One of the most painful cases occurred at 
Cambrai, shortly after Waterloo, where a party 
of the English Guards were in garrison. A young 

officer, Lieutenant G , was followed one 

day by a French officer in plain clothes, swear- 



ing and uttering the grossest insults. The 
young officer, finding it impossible to misun- 
derstand or overlook this intrusive mode of 
address, turned round and asked him to whom 
he was applying such language. "To you, and 
all English cowards!" was the answer ; which, as 
a matter of course, bore fruit in a challenge. 
The whole thing was so absurd, that the police 
authorities interfered, and promised that the 
offender should be sent away forthwith. How- 
ever, the meeting took place outside the ram- 
parts, in presence of a large number of the 
townspeople. Though pistols had been agreed 
on as the weapons, the Frenchman made his ap- 
pearance with swords, and after some discussion 
agreed to use one of his adversary's weapons. 
The young Guardsman fell at the first shot, and 
it was remarked at the time that the French 
officer gave a sort of start or stagger, whence it 
was suspected afterwards that he had been pro- 
tected by a coat of mail. While the poor youth 
was gasping and struggling in the arms of his 
friends, the Frenchman looked on calmly from a 
distance, and made this remark in a commise- 
rating tone : " Poor young man ! Had he fought 
with swords, he had been spared all this agony !" 
A party of soldiers arriving to carry off the 
slain officer, the Frenchman grew apprehensive, 
and said that it would be unfair to seize him ; 
that he had come there on the understanding, 
&c. ; but was allowed, says the chronicle, to 
depart " in the most honourable manner." That 
very evening he was seen at a cafe, exhibiting a 
handkerchief with a mark of a bullet in it, and 
boasted loudly that he had killed a Prussian, a 
Spaniard, an Austrian, and a Portuguese, and 
had, " at last, been lucky enough to kill an 
Englishman !" 

In Mr. Lever's rollicking narrative of Harry 
Lorrequer are introduced some true stories of 
these Anglo-French encounters during the "oc- 
cupation."
